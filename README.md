**March 2024 - April 2024**  

🚀 **Machine Learning | NLP | Customer Insights**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis for e-commerce reviews**, aiming to understand customer satisfaction and purchasing behavior. Using **BERT and RoBERTa**, customer feedback was analyzed and classified to align with **star ratings**, helping to assess sentiment trends. Various techniques were explored for **identifying patterns in consumer behavior**, analyzing relationships between **review scores, pricing, and payment trends**. The project also involved investigating **clustering techniques to segment consumers based on purchasing habits** and sentiment patterns. Additionally, initial explorations were conducted on **recommendation techniques** to enhance personalized user experiences based on sentiment insights. Various approaches were analyzed to understand how **customer sentiment could be leveraged for product recommendations**.
